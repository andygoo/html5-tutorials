===============
This repository provides a set of sample code you can use to learn or teach HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.

The code in the repository is explained in the blog posts on [DevDays](http://devdays.com) website.

# About HTML5 #

HTML5 is an umbrella term describing a set of HTML, CSS and JavaScript specifications designed to enable developers to build the next generation of Web sites and applications. What’s notable in that definition is its three parts: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. They define how developers use improved markup, richer style capabilities and new JavaScript APIs to make the most of new Web development features. Simply put, HTML5 = HTML + CSS + JavaScript.

When combined, these technologies form the core of modern user experience on the web. Modern browsers support many HTML5 features for developers and web designers to build a common experience across devices.

HTML5 is huge! Formally defined by an international standards body known as the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), HTML5 consists of more than 100 specifications that relate to the next generation of Web technologies.

Technologies include new HTML tags, Canvas, Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), Audio and Video, Geolocation, Web Storage and many new CSS3 modules. 

On 28 October 2014, the specification for the core HTML5 was released as a W3C Recommendation, which means that the specification process is complete. In this version, new features are introduced to help Web application authors, new elements are introduced based on research into prevailing authoring practices, and special attention has been given to defining clear conformance criteria for user agents in an effort to improve interoperability.

Other parts of the specification are at other stages. But what matters is to developers… does it work?

# Getting Started #

This blog provides a set of tutorials and sample code to help get you started writing HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript. The postings provide links to other sites and to help you dive deeper. The sample code is available on GitHub for you to try out.

When I was learning, I found snippets to be helpful, but I also wanted the context of how and where the feature fits into a project. That’s the goal of the code that is the DevDays GitHub repository.
